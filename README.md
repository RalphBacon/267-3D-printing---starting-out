### Intro  

So you are a maker confused about 3D printing?  

So you use Arduinos, ESP32s, RasPies... and others? You like the idea of 3D printing as an extension to your activities but are confused about where to start? Stay tuned!   

When I first became intrigued about 3D printing, I was overwhelmed with all the stages involved: printers, slicers and, worst of all, CAD programs. Help!  

Here I present my simplified steps to consider when diving into the murky pool of 3D printing. I even suggest that you can 3D print stuff without a printer of your own. And why not?  

### CAD programs  
I use FreeCAD, but there are quite literally 100s of CAD programs out there, all with varying degrees of complexity, capability, price (some are free) and learning curve. My only advice is to read articles on the Internet: "Best 3D CAD programs" will give you lots of results! Then download either the free version or trial version and see whether you can even make heads or tails of it.  

You will need tuition in the form of YouTube videos. For FreeCAD I use MangoJelly (https://www.youtube.com/@MangoJellySolutions) quite a bit (by Darren Stone) who guides you through pretty much every aspect of FreeCAD. But you do need to put in the effort. No shortcuts here!  

Another good resource is Make With Tech (https://www.youtube.com/@MakeWithTech) (by Irv Shapiro) who also has videos on other CAD programs, not just FreeCAD. Easy to follow and gives a very calm way of getting the information to you.
